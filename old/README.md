# lukeliasi.com
Source code for my personal website [lukeliasi.com](http://lukeliasi.com).

## 🛠️ Built with 
- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Notes
- When updating dependencies referenced in `.eleventy.js`, e.g: a `.11ty.js` template file for a shortcode, updates are not seen until the server is restarted. Fix will be shipped in v2.
